An Observer subscribes to an Observable

An Observer can call:
  next() - this updates whatever
  error()
  complete() - done and no more next calls

Observer:
  invokes next() on Observer


A Subject is a special kind of Observable. - subscribe but can manually call next(), makes a perfect event emitter
A normal Obserable is kind of passive. - set up listener and subscribe
